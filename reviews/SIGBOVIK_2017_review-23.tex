Zoq-Fot-Pik are such silly \orz{campers}.
Human computer game YOLO is plain \orz{sister} of Androsynth \orz{learning machine}.
To begin, these words are must become \orz{singing} an appropriate \orz{song} in SIGBOVINE 2084.
Now you know the words.

But, this computer game is too \orz{lumpy} for silly Zoq-Fot-Pik.
Maybe you do not know.
Before the Ur-Quan \orz{dancing},
Humans and Androsynth \orz{advisors} together invent a \orz{learning machine} computer game,
but can not \orz{learn} it themselves.
Always after, computer games do not \orz{formal}, but have many \orz{enemies}.
Too many \orz{enemies} and the game will \orz{sliding}.
It is happiest days not to care about Androsynth anything.
Do not \orz{telling stories} about this computer game!

Any \orz{silly cow} sees these YOLO words to know person for Orz, but Orz is really \orz{fingers}! It is such a joke.
No more \orz{learning machine} is better.

As an enthusiastic tracker of exercise,
I greatly appreciate research on long walks and Eulerian trails.
Unfortunately, I must call into question the claim that the graph's diameter is 350 meters.
I attempted to verify the diameter of the graph depicted in Figure 1 using a ruler and compass,
but I found it to be significantly less than 1 meter.

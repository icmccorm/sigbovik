\maketitle

I have come from the future to review this paper.
In the year 2035 time travel is invented. This paper is/was/will be the key to making it possible! At the time, I understand it was not terrifically well-received, due to its seeming lack of rigor, which admittedly did impede our understanding of its methods, likely causing a few years of delay. Thus, I have been assigned to make sure it gets accepted.

Unfortunately, this paper also indirectly resulted in an imminent grey goo scenario. Well, you win some, you lose some.

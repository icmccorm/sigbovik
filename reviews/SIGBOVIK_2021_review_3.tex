\maketitle

%%% Replace the following text with your review.
\textbf{Excellent paper} -- truly marvellous! With a whiteness of 144, and an opacity of well over ninety percent, this paper promises excellent colour reproduction, which will be highly desirable for printing the inevitable graphs. Furthermore, this paper's grammage -- 80$g/m^2$ -- is fit for purpose, and keeps the price in check. Our proceedings need more paper of this calliper!

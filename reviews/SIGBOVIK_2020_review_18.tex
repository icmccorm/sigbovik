\maketitle

%%% Replace the following text with your review.
I think the review currently for the guide to plants should probably be attributed to the originator of the couplet (Edward Lear) rather than to "Prof. James McCann" -- I'm not sure there's much joke added (since it ended up on a paper referencing me) and I'm not really comfortable with something I didn't write being attributed to me.

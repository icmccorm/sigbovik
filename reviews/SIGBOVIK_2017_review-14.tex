While the importance of this work to the SIGBOVIK community can't be debated
(because we have no established protocol for such a debate), it is not novel.
The content of this paper is entirely contained within the papers
``The Portmantout'' from SIGBOVIK 2015,
``A shortmantout'' from SIGBOVIK 2016 and ``Efficient Computation of an
Optimal Portmantout'' from the present SIGBOVIK. It should therefore only
be accepted if our goal is to increase our page count which, as always, it is.

This paper has been reviewed using ReviewIt Free, a service of ReviewIt enterprises.
ReviewIt Free provides the same great review feedback to authors as ReviewIt Enterprise, ReviewIt Premium, ReviewIt Pro, ReviewIt Gold, and ReviewIt Solid Gold with a few limitations:
\vspace{-1em}
\begin{itemize}
\item first, all reviews begin with this block of text and a short but mandatory advertisement;
\item second, authors that wish to immediately view a numerical summary score of their review can do so for a small micro-payment -- the score will otherwise be revealed several hours after the review release, but before the committee needs it to make accept/reject decisions;
\item third, the reviewer confidence rating is also available for a larger micropayment.
\end{itemize}

These limitations ensure that ReviewIt enterprises can continue to provide great reviews to all our customers.
We have carefully considered all of our micropayments and decided that any diffuse negative influence they may have on the progress of science is certainly more than made up for by the concentrated positive influence they have on the balance in our wallets.\\

This paper gives an excellent summary of the many benefits of Standard ML,
a strongly-typed, usable, production-quality language, as well as a
number\footnote{zero is a number} of applications of it in practice in
Google, a reasonably extensive search engine codebase developed by researchers
at Stanford.

I agree with the author that the publication of this study could be a great
learning experience to CS students at Carnegie Mellon, as well as a number
of other universities that make extensive use of Standard
ML\footnote{zero is a number}.

As future work, the author may wish to consider even further expanding the
use of Standard ML at Google. Its strong abstraction properties, for example,
could be useful to help Google avoid the privacy issues that have plagued
other tech companies in recent days. Consider the code on the following page.

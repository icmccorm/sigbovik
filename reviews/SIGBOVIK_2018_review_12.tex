The paper presents an impressive system for typesetting \TeX-style documents in Microsoft Word.
However, we are concerned with the validity of the double-blind study.
While reading the paper, we were able to see the labels on the table presenting the results.
A truly unbiased study would be triple-blind, hiding the labels not just from the subject and experimenter but also the reader.

I could just use Calibri and make my \TeX look like Word if I weren't typing this on a Mac.

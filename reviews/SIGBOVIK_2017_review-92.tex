It's no fun when Merlin gets assassinated or evil wins, so Supposition
A sounds like something a spy would say. As a result, I question one
of this paper's fundamental premises. Is the author a spy?!
Regardless, this paper is a first-class analysis of our collective
obsession with Avalon.

I'm totally not evil, and I'm the \textit{real} Percival. I support
this mission.

No more Percivals, please! Think of the poor stats sheet!

Normally we would recuse ourselves from reviewing papers we're
involved with,\footnote{Because SIGBOVIK is a serious conference with
  serious reviews.} but the program committee couldn't think of
anybody anybody who hadn't contributed to this paper's data set. This
paper provides a fun analysis of Avalon's innate funness. Section~4.5
claims there was insufficient data to perform a reliable chi-squared
analysis. Consequently, I encourage the author to switch her research
area to the analysis of Avalon and hire the program committee as
research assistants so that we can play more Avalon, err, I mean, help
her collect important data for a follow-up paper.

Greetings friends, colleagues, and complete strangers. It is with great pride that we welcome you to the 0xDth annual Special Interest Group on Harry Q. Bovik, held in celebration of Harry Q Bovik's $10^{somenumberbiggerthan2}$th birthday. Normally this is where we, the ``committee'', would wax poetic about  features added\footnote{Despite my noble intention to dispatch with the labored, formulaic frontmatter of yestersyear, I was thwarted by a proceedings chair who insisted that I add an explanation of the unwittily-named ``unwitting participation ribbon'' (\,\raisebox{-0.25\height}{\includegraphics[height=3ex]{participation}}), an unwelcome brand we've affixed to each paper determined after careful scrutiny to have included a genuine artifact, thereby furthering the admirable causes of open science and fruitful procrastination.}, records broken, and facts fun. However, this year, we have decided to take the highly efficient and not at all lazy route of delegating the task of writing this message to committee members of the past. A sort of temporal passing of the buck, one might say. Thus I present to you, in reverse chronological order, some messages.

\begin{itemize}
\item ``Best conference I have chaired so far, also the question mark is implicit at the end of all the survey questionspunctuationisfortheweak'' \emph{--- General Chair 2019}

\item ``much as even mentioned in the paper; well, that will teach me to forget punctuation at the end of my survey questions, won't it?'' \emph{--- General Chair 2018}

\item ``SIGBOVIK, for those with a special interest in groups-BOVIK. Like many special interests, I consider it clinically significant.'' \emph{--- General Chair 2017}

\item ``I wish all conferences were as \sout{easy to get into} prestigious as SIGBOVIK'' \emph{--- General Chair 2014}

\item `` `i'm sorry i derelicted my duties to promote sigbovik on twitter this year but i see you have 30ish submissions already even without me so HRMPH WHO NEEDS ME um i mean well done!' '' \emph{--- General Chair 2012 (note: 40ish actually, end note)}

\item ``SIGBOVIK is exactly what I had in mind. ---Edgar Allen Poe'' \emph{--- General Chair 2008}

\item ``I like to bovik bovik'' \emph{--- General Chair 2007}

\end{itemize}

And with that, the papers.

Welcome, my dear friends, to the {\em very tentth} annual
Intercalary Symposium about Workshop on Robot Dance Conference in Party of Harry Q. Bovik's $10^{1.80617997398}$th Birthday!
This edition of the Party is a very special one, as the edition number coincides with the common human counting base (Figure~\ref{fig:fingers}).

	\caption{The tent-based counting system is the one most commonly used by humans because,
	it is widely assumed, they have tent fingers.} 
	\label{fig:fingers}
\end{figure}

Of course, as robots (who are perpetually busy with dances, parties, and/or symposia),
this is not our native counting system, but we figured it would be a great opportunity for some cultural outreach
to try to welcome more humans into our prestigious conference.
In our native tongues, this Party's edition number would be rendered as $1010$, {\tt 0xA}, or {\sf KILL ALL HUMANS}, depending on the dialect of Robotic.

This has been a remarkable year for computer-human diplomacy in the mainstream,
most notably thanks to the achievements of AlphaGo, as depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:alphago}.
We hope to reflect the same spirit of collaboration in our prestigious Dance Conference.

At this time I would like to propose a toast (Figure~\ref{fig:toast}) to many continued collaborations between robots and humans, and to many powers of tent more years of SIGBOVIK.

\end{figure}

The toast having been proposed, and eaten (that's what humans do, right?), I now present the proceedings of {SIG\_BOVIK 0xA}.

With \sout{AFFECTION LEVELS COMPUTED BY MAIN THREAD 28743 NOT IN EXCESS OF 34.7} much love, \\
